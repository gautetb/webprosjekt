        <p>This solution results the best way to get rid of unwanted emails and makes sure you receive the information you want
            to the correct e-mail address. Now, let’s get into the e-Tracker website.</p>
        <h3>e-Tracker: The first page</h3>
        <img src="h.png" alt="first page">
        <p>What you see here is the e-Tracker’s home page. This is the first page you will see when you click into e-Tracker.
            Here we have a big get started button which will help you make a new user. Then we have our navigation bar which
            starts with home button for our first page. Then info button for more information about the e-Tracker than the
            first page. The next is a contact button which gives you contact information. The button “about us” gives you
            information about the founders of e-Tracker. Then we have the login button that log in those who already are
            an user of e-Tracker. We also have a tutorial video on this page that shows how to use eTracker application.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>Privacy is our number one priority when it comes to our users, we want them to feel as safe and secure as possible.
            Privacy is very important when it comes to e-mail, for that reason we have focused on a secure login, so only
            you can see the services you are registered to. We will use a verification method where you have to confirm your
            e-mail by clicking on a link that is sent to that particular e-mail that you wish to register. This way we know
            that the e-mail belongs to you and that you e-mail is not being misused. You as a user can also use a SMSservice
            verification so your user at our site is more secure. That is why our website is both secure and safe to use
            by design.</p>
        <h3>My Account</h3>
        <img src="sa.png" alt="account image">
        <p>Here we see the site we will come to when we login. Now we have a “My Account” button instead of a login button.
            If we click that button, the site will open a drop down menu with “manage your email” which is the site you are
            on now, then “setting” for password change and other information change. Then we have “history” that gives you
            log of what you have done with your mails and services since you first created an e-Tracker user. And at the
            end we have a “Log out” button that log you out.</p>
        <h3>Manage your emails</h3>
        <p>You are able to use whichever e-mail client you want, for instance e-mail address from Gmail, Yahoo or Outlook. If
            you are using multiple e-mails you can add as many e-mail addresses as you wish by clicking “Add Email” . We
            highly suggest that you add your main accounts in order to maintain control over which services have access to
            your e-mail.</p>
        <h3>The selected email address</h3>
        <img src="yt.png" alt="selected email image">
        <p>When you select an account you get greeted with a detailed page about that particular account. Let’s say that your
            Facebook account is one of the listed items on the page. Selecting Facebook will provide short and concise information
            about the website. From here you also get the options to change or remove the linked e-mail address. This is
            especially handy if you want to use a different mail for the same Facebook account. Or - you could just remove
            the site so that it is no longer connected to your e-mail address.</p>
        <h3>The design: Accessible for everyone</h3>
        <p>Our design choices affects how our service is being used and who it is being used by. Because our goal is to include
            every single user that has minimum one email address, who can be anyone with or without disability, we had to
            consider every single aspect of our solution. So we used
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/designing">tips on designing for web accessibility</a> from
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to make sure that the design is more accessible to people with disabilities. We also checked our web
            page at
            <a href="http://checkers.eiii.eu/">European Internet Inclusion Initiativ</a>, which checks the accessibility of a web page.</p>
        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>The technology that you are using should be adapting to the context that you are using it in. We don’t have our computers
            available to us at all times and therefore it would be a great disadvantage if the technology did not adjust
            to our demands. From a smartphone you can use our service just the way you are used to from the desktop experience.
            As well as tablets. That will make us have a greater audience</p>
        <p>But, how did we make our website responsive? We just made sure that we didn’t use any absolute sizes in our website.
            Every single element in the website has its size defined by relative units, which makes our website responsive
            to different mediums. Sometimes relative units won’t work as good as we thought, then we just make the design
            a little bit different for example for smartphones than computers. Like the first page for this informal website
            has a different design for computer than if you click into this website on a smartphone.</p>
