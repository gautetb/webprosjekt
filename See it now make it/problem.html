        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>Everything technological that is too time consuming is a problem from a technological perspective. Especially if
            we could get the work done in minutes. Let’s look at these kinds of problems. But first, let us ask you some
            questions. Are you aware of all the services that are connected to your email address? Have you always had the
            same email address ever since you created one? You would probably answer “no” to at least one of the questions
            above. Then you would probably have experienced problems with unwanted emails or problems with changing to new
            email address without knowing the important services that has your old email address. Let's look at what people
            say about this.</p>
        <h3>Our research</h3>
        <p>We made a survey consisting of six questions. The survey was conducted in november 2016 among 100 email users from
            different age groups all around the world. The users were informed about that this survey is only being used
            to this final project. We will use the results of the survey to show the importance of the problems we will address
            soon. The results:</p>
        <img src="1.png" alt="picture 1">
        <p>Here we can see that 6% of the users were from age 12-18, 38% of user were from age 19-40, 39% of the users were
            from age 41-55 and 6% from age 56+.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows that over 90% of the people didn't have the same email address ever since they created one.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows that over 90% of the people aren't aware of all the services connected to their email address.</p>
        <img src="4.png" alt="picture 4">
        <p>This diagram shows that over 70% of the people think that their unawareness of the places their email is registered
            to is a big problem.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows that over 70% of the users would have used the application we will be describing as our solution
            for the problems we will be adressing now.</p>
        <h3>The First Problem</h3>
        <p>The first problem: Unwanted emails. How do you handle unwanted emails? You can try to manually go and unsubscribe
            from every sender of the unwanted emails, delete every time you get an unwanted email, ignore every time you
            get an unwanted email, set up filters or report the unwanted email as spam. Let’s look at how our email users
            handle this problem.</p>
        <img src="6.png" alt="picture 6">
        <p>These methods to prevent unwanted emails are too time consuming or annoying. From a technological perspective, this
            is a problem. How can we possibly prevent this time consuming work with unwanted emails? The answer is “e-Tracker”.
            We will tell you about it later. But first, let us address the second problem.</p>
        <h3>The Second Problem</h3>
        <p>The first time you created an email address, you probably wouldn’t have thought of using it for professional inquiries.
            So, your first email address would have been something like sexyboy97@live.no, barbie23@gmail.com, kittygirl@yahoo.com
            or kingofoslo@hotmail.com. And now you want your email address to be more professional. So, you create a new
            email address. Or you just have another good reason to change your email address, so you create a new one. Here
            you can see how many of our email users that have changed their email addresses. Which is over 90% as said earlier.</p>
        <img src="2.png" alt="picture 2">
        <p>But you have your previous email address registered to so many services that you don’t have any overview over the
            important ones. So, you must manually go and find the important services and send an email about your new email
            address. This is also time consuming which is also a problem from a technological perspective. And as said over
            70% of our survey answerers think this is a big problem too.</p>
        <img src="4.png" alt="picture 4">
        <p>How can we possibly prevent this time-consuming work forever? The answer for this one is “eTracker” too. What is
            this e-Tracker? The “e-Tracker” is a web-based application and our solution for the problems we adressed. You
            can read about our solution by clicking "Solution" in the navigation bar or you can click
